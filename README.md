# Stick

Stick is a 2D library that is made for simplicity and usefulness. You doesn't need to care about lots of parameters just for seeing something at your screen or complex rendering procedures, we do it for you; and if you're not happy with our procedure, create yourself one!
Stick can also be upgraded. For example, you can choose one of our assets pack (located outside of Stick itself) to create your game! Do you need an RPG? Or is an FPS? Or both? No problem!
